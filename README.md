#### Discription:
**Problem:** The goal of this project is to classify images of dogs according to their breed.
**Strategy to solve the problem:** We will solve this problem using ResNet50, a deep-learning model and transfer learning. 
The project provide a web app as well, that accepts any image and output the name of the dog bread.

#### Requirements:
To run the experiment, you need to install jupyter notebook to run dog_app.ipynb
Python requirements:
- Flask
- sklearn       
- keras
- numpy
- import
- cv2
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- PIL

#### Metric:
In this project, we aim to improve the model accuracy, we will chose the checkpoint with the highest accuracy.
Acuuracy metric is defined as the number of correct predictions over the number of total predictions.

#### Data Analysis:
